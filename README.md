# HeartTrailAnimation
Our project involves creating a heart rate animation that responds to mouse movement in the browser. As the mouse moves, hearts of varying colors and sizes will appear on the screen. Keyframe queries will modify the opacity, size, and hue of the hearts. To track the mouse's position in the browser, we'll use JavaScript. With this information, we'll position the heart in the exact location of the cursor. This interactive feature will personalize the user experience and respond to their movements in real-time. By combining these elements, we'll develop an engaging and dynamic animation that captures the user's attention and provides a fun and interactive experience on the webpage.
